This corovirus is a serious situation and attending carnival to wine and jam for a two days is risking your family and love one's life because we do not know who will be jamming alongside you. There are no early symptoms...we do not know who might be traveling here to our little island and already infected. Whether or not the government decides to still carry on with carnival this year, we the people who actually have the power should cancel this potentially \"suicidal event\" and stay indoors!!!"

All the order does is seek to instil a temporary restraint on the person from causing harm to the other. The police cannot be blamed except they have a crystal ball and power of a wizard to get there in that second. In short, people will do what they want to do and the law picks up after the event. So the best protection order you can get if you have a violent partner is to skip the country and cut ties with everyone."
