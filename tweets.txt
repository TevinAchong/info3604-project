@_em_smith @IM_MARTYR HAHAHA!! Sir, I believe you're losing badly today.
@RamsinghAdrian Lmao what percentage? Like 5-10% at most? That’s not enough 😂

But yeah, I agree. Storytelling is one of the elements of soca and calypso that we need to reconnect with to push the art form further.

@iamdcarrington Exactly it should be called soca, I love groovy soca dislike the term.
People out here selling marijuana snacks and shit... I wonder if y’all even took the time to check through the legality and all the possibly problems allyuh could find allyuh self in.. smh... Trinidad = neverseecomesee
Brother.... sister I don’t work for y’all
@shuaayow Steups
@nigel_qu Thanks! 

Just to be clear though, do you dislike groovy soca or do you dislike the name it goes by because in your eyes it should just be called soca?
I'm all for finding love but I honestly find it sad that these girls so desperately seek validation from one guy. Validate yourself first and then everything else will fall into place #thebachelor
Some of my guy friends soo romantic eh...I'm so proud of them, making their girl feel like princesses 🥺🥰

Very well articulated, you basically covered everything. This is why I dislike the fake sub-genre “groovy soca” because to me soca was always groovy. Also great music is given an expiration date because we “must” have only new music for a new carnival season. Crazy. https://t.co/LYosZdElkg
